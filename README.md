# Simple-Web-Scraper
This is a simple web scraper built using Python and the BeautifulSoup library. It allows the user to input a website URL and an HTML tag to scrape, and then extracts all instances of that tag from the website using BeautifulSoup. The scraped items are then printed out to the console.

## Getting Started
To use this web scraper, you'll need to have Python and the BeautifulSoup library installed on your computer. You can install BeautifulSoup using pip by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install beautifulsoup4
python web_scraper.py

When prompted, enter the website URL (e.g. https://example.com) and the HTML tag to scrape (e.g. a). The script will then scrape the website and print out all instances of the specified HTML tag.
